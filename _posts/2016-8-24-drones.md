## Drone platform consultations

There are multiple types of drone platforms available on the market today (multirotor aircraft, fixed wings etc.). Knowing their strengths and weaknesses is the first step towards selecting the right platform for the job. The second step is knowing the local regulations in order to perform your missions legally and in a safe manner. 

## High level drone development

I have experience with implementing and integrating high level autonomy on Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). The examples of my work include development of auto takeoff and auto landing functionality for fixed wing, multirotor and helicopter platforms. I also have an experience integrating various sensor types on multirotor and fixed wing platforms (e.g. time of flight sensors for height control and obstacle avoidance).
